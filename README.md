# Catalina Island data cleanup
In preparation for a trip to Catalina Island, let's arm-chair map as much as we can.

## Tasks
- Import [176 fire hydrants](https://github.com/socal-osm/catalina-cleanup/blob/master/data/fire-hydrants.geojson) to OpenStreetMap
- Clean up roads
- Import addresses for the island
- Add any features appearing on the county's tiles
- ..and more..

## More resources
- [Catalina Island Co. maps](http://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/island-info/maps) could be used for reference, but not to copy directly into OSM
- [Catalina Conservancy maps](https://www.catalinaconservancy.org/index.php?s=general&p=map_island) again, not to copy but could be used for place names or feature help
